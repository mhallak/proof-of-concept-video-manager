New:

Later kernels may have a built in driver for the 812.
You may choose to use this driver instead.  No compilation or installation
is needed, the device will appear as /dev/video0 to /dev/video7
(or higher numbers if other V4L devices are installed).

To test for built-in kernel driver run the following command in this directory:

./driver.py

If the built in kernel driver is present, please quit and start using
this driver.

If not, you will need to install the driver in the driver or driver/vbuf2 directory.

Please try the driver in code first.  If this does not work, it is because
the kernel does not have videobuf1 installed.  In this situation, use the
driver in code/vbuf2.


Kernels supported: 2.6.26 to latest (currently 4.12)
Please note that newer versions unreleased as of 09/26/2017
should work also.  If not, please email support@sensoray.com
